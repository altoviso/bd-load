# bdLoad - The Backdraft Loader

bdLoad is is an [AMD](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/AsynchronousDefinition)-compliant script-injection loader
for loading javascript resources into the browser. Its design places a high value on minimum size and maximum run-time
and build-time configurability.

A tutorial is available at [http://bdframework.org/docs/loader/loader.html](http://bdframework.org/docs/loader/loader.html).

A complimentary build system is available at [https://github.com/altoviso/bdBuild](https://github.com/altoviso/bdBuild).

## Status

bdLoad has been in use privately since 2008 and its internal machinery is fairly mature. The project was made public in
late 2010 and has been extended to include [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) compatibility. Expect a final, versioned
release of bdLoad in January 2011.
